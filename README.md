# IBM_ETL
Focuses on completing an ETL to understand the exchange rates of USD and GBP between the largest Banks.

This is a peer review assignment sponsored by IBM and my second ETL job, focuses on:
1. Extracting Market Cap of the largest Banks in USD 
2. Transform: Converting the USD to GPB, and rounding up into 3 decimals
3. Loading the data into a new file.
